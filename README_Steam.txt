[h1]VR Software Status[/h1]
Objective: Investigate software such as [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search?vrsupport=401%2C402&os=linux]these native titles on Steam[/url] to find whether they actually support virtual reality (VR) on Linux. In addition, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561]Steam Play[/url] whitelisted software will also be tracked. Please post whatever issues you have.

This document is VR-focused, but augmented reality (AR) applications will also be included. (Together, VR and AR are known as XR.)

Make sure to use the latest graphics drivers and Linux kernel available to you. At a minimum, Linux kernel 4.13 with Mesa 18.2 (AMD) or Nvidia version 430.26 is required for the SteamVR beta. For more details on SteamVR for Linux, [url=https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux]click here.[/url]

For unsupported games that may work with [url=https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/]Proton,[/url] see [url=https://gitlab.com/vr-on-linux/VR-on-Linux/-/tree/master/Proton]the list on Gitlab[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/250820/discussions/5/4839692156569764298/]the Steam forum thread[/url].

[h2]Unofficial ALVR Support (Experimental)[/h2]
Some Oculus headsets are supported by [url=https://alvr-org.github.io/]ALVR[/url] (Air Light VR).
[quote]Stream VR games from your PC to your headset via Wi-Fi.
ALVR uses technologies like Asynchronous Timewarp and Fixed Foveated Rendering for a smoother experience.
All games that work with an Oculus Rift (s) should work with ALVR.[/quote]
[quote]Linux support is still in beta. To be able to make audio work or run ALVR at all you may need advanced knowledge of your distro for debugging or building from source.[/quote]
ALVR currently supports:[list]
[*]Oculus Quest 1/2/Pro
[*]Pico 4/Neo 3
[*]Vive Focus 3/XR Elite
[*]YVR 1/2[/list]

[h2]Graphics Cards[/h2]
You should try to get the latest graphics drivers that are available. For Nvidia users, have at least the NVIDIA 470.42.01 driver installed, available since June 22, 2021. For AMD users, have at least Mesa 18.2 (September 2018). Intel graphics are not currently supported by SteamVR.

[hr]
[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]

[h2]SteamVR[/h2]

[h3]Rainbow pixels at the edge of my viewport (AMDGPU)[/h3]

SteamVR only renders what can actually be seen by the player. This results in two ovals being drawn on the HMD. SteamVR does not touch the outside of those ovals. That results in random pixels from the VRAM segment the frame buffer was allocated on.
You can probably see these if you move your eyes quick enough and are looking at a dark scene in VR.

You can tell the RADV driver to always zero the frame buffer to avoid this. I am not sure if this results in a performance penalty or not.

[b]Fix[/b]
[list][*]Add this environment variable to the launch options of SteamVR: `RADV_DEBUG=zerovram`
[list][*]NOTE: You can add multiple options to `RADV_DEBUG` by separating them with a comma (`,`). Example: `RADV_DEBUG=zerovram,nodcc`[/list][/list]

[h3]SteamVR doesn't start on Wayland[/h3]

If you have environment variables that force Qt or SDL apps to run in Wayland mode, SteamVR might not start at all.

[b]Fix[/b]
[list][*]Add these environment variables to the launch options of SteamVR: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11`[/list]

[h3]SteamVR does not use direct mode on Wayland (window appears on monitor)[/h3]

If this has never worked for you on Wayland, make sure your compositor supports the `wp_drm_lease_device_v1` protocol. (As of writing both Sway and KWin support it)

[b]Fix[/b]
[list][*]Use a compositor that supports `wp_drm_lease_device_v1`
[*]Make sure your XWayland version supports `wp_drm_lease_device_v1` (X.Org 22.1.0+)[/list]

[h3]SteamVR *occasionally* does not use direct mode on Wayland (window appears on monitor)[/h3]

Sometimes SteamVR fails to use direct mode. This is probably because the last instance didn't release its lease on your HMD. You can kill `XWayland` and try again (Sway automatically restarts it when needed)

If your HMD is listed in the output of `xrandr`, it probably means that it's available for lease.

[b]Fix[/b]
[list][*]Restart XWayland
[*]Alternatively restart your compositor[/list]

[h3]No microphone input from HMD[/h3]

The microphone of the Valve Index is kinda finnicky. Your best bet is to use PipeWire here.
PulseAudio can be made to work, if you figure out the correct sample-rate and stuff.

**Fix**
[list][*]Use PipeWire
[*](Maybe) Make sure you have selected the corresponding HDMI output (the Index won't capture the microphone otherwise?)[/list]

[h3]Double-vision when moving head[/h3]

Asynchronous reprojection is broken in SteamVR on Linux. If games generate enough frames, you won't see this. But if the games framerate is too low, you will probably experience this.
There is no real fix, as disabling asynchronous reprojection will just reduce the perceived framerate on your HMD.

[b]Fix[/b]
[list][*]Disable async reprojection (degrades perceived performance) by setting `"enableLinuxVulkanAsync" : false` under the `steamvr` section at `~/.steam/steam/config/steamvr.vrsettings`[/list]

[h3]Graphics artifacts in SteamVR and in overlays (AMDGPU)[/h3]

[url=https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/395]Upstream issue[/url]

[b]Fix[/b]
[list][*]Add this environment variable to the launch options of SteamVR: `RADV_DEBUG=nodcc`
[list][*]NOTE: You can add multiple options to `RADV_DEBUG` by separating them with a comma (`,`). Example: `RADV_DEBUG=zerovram,nodcc`[/list][/list]

[h3]Overlays are wobbling/jittering[/h3]

[url=https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/395]Upstream issue[/url]

This is a SteamVR bug and it can't really be fixed from the outside.

There is some discussion in [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality_linux/comments/yucy6i/steamvr_flickering_with_asyn_reprojection_solved/]this Reddit thread[/url] about some workarounds, but they can cause issues with some games.
