Here is how you can help!

 * Anyone can:
   * Provide links to tests that people have posted elsewhere.
   * Ask VR developers whether they plan Linux support, if it's not listed here.
   * Suggest improvements to this documentation, whether in content or layout, by posting an [issue], or...
   * Create a fork (your edited version) and make a merge request.
 * If you have access to a VR headset, you can:
   * Test software or hardware for Linux VR compatibility.
     * Whether it works fine, works but has issues, or doesn't work at all, you can post an [issue] or post a comment on Steam.
 * If you don't have access to a VR headset, you can:
   * Gift a VR application to someone who does, and is willing to test in Linux.
     * You should both be aware of the [Steam refund policy].

For the Steam thread/guide, I don't yet have a reliable, automatic way to convert to Steam BBCode. I just do it manually, as contributions are not too frequent. You can edit it too if you want, but you don't need to.
