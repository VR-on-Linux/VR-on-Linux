Here is how you can help!

 * Anyone can:
   * Provide links to tests that people have posted elsewhere.
   * Suggest improvements to this documentation, whether in content or layout, by posting an [issue], or...
   * [Create a branch], and make a [merge request] with your changes made.
   * Ask VR developers whether they plan Linux support, if it's not listed here.
 * If you have access to a VR headset, you can:
   * Test software or hardware for Linux VR compatibility.
     * Whether it works fine, works but has issues, or doesn't work at all, you can post an [issue] for it. After that, we can also add you as a maintainer, if you wished to edit the README directly.
 * If you don't have access to a VR headset, you can:
   * Gift a VR application to someone who does, and is willing to test in Linux.
     * You should both be aware of the [Steam refund policy].

To make managing [PROTON.md] easier, you can use PROTON.md.ods. Or if you prefer, just edit PROTON.md directly.
