Here is how you can help!

Anyone can:

* Share links to tests that people have posted elsewhere (native or not)
* Ask VR developers whether they have tested with [Proton] or have tried building for Linux.
* Suggest improvements to this documentation, whether in content or layout, by posting an [issue], or...
* Create a fork (your edited version) and make a merge request.

If you have access to a VR headset, you can:

* Test software or hardware for Linux VR compatibility.
  * Whether it works fine, works but has issues, or doesn't work at all, you can post an [issue] or post a comment on Steam.
 
If you don't have access to a VR headset, you can:

* Gift a VR application to someone who does, and is willing to test in Linux.
  * You should both be aware of the [Steam refund policy].

For the Steam thread/guide, I don't have a reliable, automatic way to convert to Steam BBCode. I just do it manually, as contributions are not too frequent. You can edit it too if you want, but you don't need to.
