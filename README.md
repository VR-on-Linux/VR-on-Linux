# VR Hardware Status

### Confirmed Working

* HTC Vive - 
  [SteamVR for Linux Github](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux)
  (development release)
* Oculus Rift development kits (DK1, DK2) - 
  [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Oculus_Rift)

### Unofficial OpenHMD Support

[These currently lack positional tracking functionality][openhmd], and not as many games 
support OpenHMD yet. But for developers, it's a great option.

* Oculus Rift
